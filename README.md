	  <h1>Welcome to my Page!</h1>
	  <h2>About me</h2>
	  <p>Hi, my name is Darshan and I am a Master's student at NYU Tandon, majoring in Computer Science</p><br>
	  <p>Here is a link to my channel: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/kgmit">youtube.com/kgmit</a></p>
	  <p>I grew up in the great state of New Hampshire here in the USA. From an early age I always loved math. Around my senior year of high school, my brother first introduced me to programming. I found it a creative way to apply the same type of logical thinking skills that I enjoyed with math. This influenced me to study computer science in college and ultimately create a YouTube channel to share some things that I have learned along the way.</p>
	  <h3>Hobbies</h3>
	  <p>Believe it or not, I don't code 24/7. I love doing all sorts of active things. I like to play ice hockey & table tennis as well as run, hike, skateboard, and snowboard. In addition to sports, I am a board game enthusiast. The two that I've been playing the most recently are <i>Settlers of Catan</i> and <i>Othello</i>.</p>
